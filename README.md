# kleros-interaction
Smart contracts able to interact with Kleros and standard proposals.

NOTE: in order to see my contribution to this project, you will have to go to Pull requests > Closed > #33 OR Issues > Closed > #16. I do not show up in the contribution history anywhere. This is because at the time, my local git commits used a default mac fake email, and so are not linked to my Github, despite being credited to "Toby Weed."
